                            include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media type for

                            A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a
                            comma to separate values. Each line of the file
                            is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use
                            of
                            the comma as a field
                            separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores
                            tabular
                            data (numbers and text) in
                            plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.
                            The CSV file format is not fully standardized. The basic idea of separating fields with a
                            comma
                            is clear, but the
                            situation gets complicated when field data also contain commas or embedded line breaks.

                        YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable
                        data-serialization
                        language. It is
                        commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or
                        transmitted.
                        YAML targets many
                        of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal
                        syntax
                        which intentionally
                        differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact

                        Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
                        documents in a format
                        that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0
                        Specification of 1998
                        and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML.
                        The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It
                        is a
                        textual data
                        format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML
                        focuses on documents,
                        the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those
                        used
                        in web services.
